# Phuong's Chapter

## Hey Chuck,

Let me know if you need a blog or a digital space to write your new book "A lost is a lost but a win is a Nguyen". 
Also, maybe one of your clients would benefit having the information you give them placed in this format. I think Rust MD books is one 
of the cooler technologies out there and comes bootstrapped with so much goodies such as a search bar, a table of contents, the ability to change the theme up as you like.
